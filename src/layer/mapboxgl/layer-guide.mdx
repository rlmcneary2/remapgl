# Layer

The [Code Sandbox "Map
Layers"](https://codesandbox.io/embed/map-layers-w2hu4?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark)
is a working example of working with Layers in remapgl.

     style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px;
     overflow:hidden;" title="Map Layers" allow="geolocation; microphone;

## Sample Code

The following code illustrates how an array of objects with layer data is being
mapped into Layer components that are children of a [Map](/map) component.

```jsx
<Map accessToken={accessToken}>
  {layers.map(layer => (
      <Layer
        id={`${layer.id}.${layer.type}`}
        key={`${layer.id}.${layer.type}`}
        paint={layerPaint(layer)}
        source={layerSource(layer)}
        type={layer.type}
      />
    ))}
</Map>
```

## Types

There are different types of Mapbox GL layers. They allow a variety of different
geometric objects to be drawn on the map including circles, lines, and polygons.
Layers are typically made of two parts: a "source" that defines the shape of
the layer, and "paint" that configures how the geometry appears when rendered.

Layers are complex - for details about layer types, styles, and options that
change their appearance consult the [Mapbox GL
documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/#layers).


## Order

The order of the layers that are children of a Map affects how the layers are
rendered in the map. In the same way that lower elements in an HTML document
overlap higher layers, the last layer in an array of layers will appear above
the other layers.

Note that Mapbox GL layers do not result in DOM objects. Layers are rendered as
graphics in the map.
