# Map
The `<Map/>` component creates and displays a map. The Map can be controlled and interacted with via its props. The only required prop is `accessToken`. This is [a string token provided by Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/), you will need to create a Mapbox account to get one.

A Map component can accept a number of other components as children. Data at a specific point is displayed on a map using a [Marker](/marker). Information that applies to paths or regions on a map can be applied by [Layer](/layer) components.
