# Map
The `<Map/>` component creates and displays a map. The Map can be controlled and interacted with via its props. The only required prop is `accessToken`. This is [a string token provided by Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/), you will need to create a Mapbox account to get one.

A Map component can accept a number of other components as children. Data at a specific point is displayed on a map using a [Marker](/marker). Information that applies to paths or regions on a map can be applied by [Layer](/layer) components.

|Property|Type|Comments|
|---|---|---|
|duration?|number|The animation's duration, measured in milliseconds.|
|easing?|(input: number) => number|A function taking a time in the range 0..1 and returning a number where 0 is the initial state and 1 is the final state.|

### BoundsOptions

|Property|Type|Comments|
|---|---|---|
|**bounds**|LngLatBounds|Center these bounds in the viewport and use the highest zoom level up to and including maxZoom that fits them in the viewport.|
|eventData?|object|Additional properties to be added to event objects of events triggered by a change.|

### CenterOptions

|Property|Type|Comments|
|---|---|---|
|**center**|LngLat|The geographical center point of the map. Changing this value will cause the map position to change.|

### LngLat
Represents a geographic location on the map. When using the tuple (array) signature the first element is the longitude and the second element is the latitude.
`[number, number]` | `{ lat: number; lng: number; }`

### LngLatBounds
Represents a geographic rectangle on a map. A tuple; the first element is the south west corner, the second element is the north east corner.
`[LngLat, LngLat]`
